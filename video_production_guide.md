### Code Example Standards

#### Python for Beginners
```python
# Always include clear comments
def calculate_budget(income, expenses):
    """
    Calculate remaining budget after expenses
    
    Args:
        income (float): Monthly income
        expenses (list): List of expense amounts
    
    Returns:
        float: Remaining budget
    """
    total_expenses = sum(expenses)
    remaining = income - total_expenses
    return remaining

# Example usage with clear variable names
monthly_income = 3000.0
monthly_expenses = [1200, 500, 200, 300]  # rent, food, utilities, misc

remaining_budget = calculate_budget(monthly_income, monthly_expenses)
print(f"Remaining budget: ${remaining_budget:.2f}")
```

#### Python for DevOps
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
System Health Monitor
A comprehensive tool for monitoring system resources
"""

import psutil
import logging
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Dict, List

# Configure logging for production use
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

class SystemMonitor:
    """Monitor system resources and generate alerts"""
    
    def __init__(self, cpu_threshold: float = 80.0, 
                 memory_threshold: float = 85.0):
        self.cpu_threshold = cpu_threshold
        self.memory_threshold = memory_threshold
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    def check_system_health(self) -> Dict[str, any]:
        """Perform comprehensive system health check"""
        try:
            health_data = {
                'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
                'cpu_percent': psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1),
                'memory_percent': psutil.virtual_memory().percent,
                'disk_usage': self._get_disk_usage(),
                'alerts': []
            }
            
            # Generate alerts based on thresholds
            health_data['alerts'] = self._generate_alerts(health_data)
            
            return health_data
            
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error checking system health: {e}")
            raise
```

## Recording Best Practices

### Audio Quality
- Record in a quiet environment
- Use noise reduction in post-production
- Maintain consistent volume levels
- Include a 5-second silence at the beginning for noise profiling

### Visual Quality
- Ensure good lighting on your face
- Keep the background clean and professional
- Use a consistent setup across all videos
- Maintain eye contact with the camera

### Screen Recording
- Use high contrast themes (dark background, light text)
- Increase font sizes for better readability
- Hide desktop clutter and notifications
- Use zoom effects for small code details

### Presentation Tips
```
Speaking Guidelines:
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Pause briefly between concepts
- Use transitions between topics
- Repeat important points
- Ask rhetorical questions to engage viewers

Energy and Enthusiasm:
- Start with high energy
- Vary your tone and pace
- Show genuine excitement about the topic
- Use hand gestures (if visible)
- Smile when appropriate
```

### Error Handling During Recording
- Don't edit out small mistakes - fix them live
- Explain your debugging process
- Use errors as teaching opportunities
- Keep a calm demeanor when things go wrong
